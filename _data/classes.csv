Function, operation, and application of common mechanical engineering instruments, measurement principles, and statistical analysis. Major elements of measurement systems, including transduction, signal conditioning, and data recording.  This class is now taught as ME 351."
ME,499/599,osu,Computer Programming for Mechanical Systems,"This is an introduction to Python programming and some of the basic concepts in computer science for mechanical engineers.  The goal of the class is to get students to think of computer programming as just another tool in their toolkit, and to show them how to use it to do the sorts of tasks that they will encounter in their mechanical engineering careers.  This class is not longer taught, but has evolved into ME 203."
ENGR,112,osu,Introduction to Engineering Computing,"This is our introduction to Matlab programming for engineers.  It covers the basics of Matlab programming, and how to use it to solve practical problems encountered in a variety of engineering disciplines."
HC,299,osu,Design and Technology for the Silver Tsunami,"This was an Honors College seminar class that looked at some of the issues of designing technology for an ageing population.  We talked about the physical and cognitive changes that happen as we age, and how this affects the design process and our use of technology.  This class was team taught with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-katharine-hunter-zaworski-3015251/"">Kate hunter-Zaworski</a> from Civil Engineering and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aldwin-carolyn-5773644b/"">Carolyn Aldwyn</a> from the College of Public Health and Human Sciences."
HC,407,osu,Understanding the Robotics Revolution,"This was an Honors College seminar course, where we look at how to explain the technology behind robotics and AI to people without a technical background, co-taught with <a href=""https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/cindy-grimm"">Cindy Grimm</a>.  The focus of the class was on trying to understand what people need to know about these technologies to allow them to understand their benefits, risks, and limitations, and to make informed decisions about the technology."
CSE,517,wustl,Machine Learning,"This class is a broad introduction to the field of machine learning.  It covers the main sub-fields and algorithms,and gives students practical experience of applying machine learning techniques to real problems.  Machine learning is a very active research area, and is starting to have an impact in the ""real world"".  Companies like Google make exensive use of machine learning algorithms in their systems.  The class covers many of the common algorithms and techniques from the field, and shows you how to design your own machine learning systems.  Some of the material is quite mathematical, so you should be comfortable with basic calculus and linear algebra before taking this class.	Formerly CS 527A."
CSE,550,wustl,Mobile Robotics,"This is the introductory mobile robotics class.  The class is a broad introduction to mobile robotics, covering a lot of material from power sources and gear trains, up to high-level control and sensor-interpretation algorithms.  Students in the class get the chance to program both simulated and real robots, using the <a href=""https://ros.org/"">Robot Operating System (ROS)</a> robot middleware.  To take this class, you need to be able to write code in either Python or C++ (and preferably both).  We will not teach any programming during the class, and you're going to be miserable if you don't already know it.  To get the most out of the class, you will also need some mathematical skills.  We use some calculus, some linear algebra, and some probability in the techniques and algorithms that we cover.  If you don't have some background in each of these, then you will not be able to follow a lot of the material."
CSE,553,wustl,Advanced Mobile Robotics,"This class follows on from CSE 550, and looks at some of the most recent work in the field of mobile robotics.  Lecture material is taken from current research papers, often less than a year old.  Students work on individual or small-group projects that implement the key elements of the papers that we cover in class.  Since we're covering advanced material in this class, we assume that you already know the basic algorithms and techniques of mobile robotics.  If you have not taken CSE 550, or an equivalent class, you're going to be hopelessly lost.  We also go into more mathematical detail in the class, so you should be comfortable with calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory.  Since much of the grade for this class is based on your project, you should be very comfortable writing and debugging code in C++ or Python (and preferably both).  Class projects for CSE 553 will use our research robot platforms."
CSE,402,wustl,Mathematical Tools for Computer Science,"This was a class we ran for graduate students coming from outside of computer science, to bring them up to speed with some of the mathematical tools used in robotics, machine learning, graphics, and computer vision.  The web site is lost to the sands of time, but there's an <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20040429044156/http://userfs.cec.wustl.edu/~cs402/"">archived page</a> at the <a  href=""https://archive.org"">Wayback Machine</a>."
CSE,332,wustl,Object-Oriented Software,"This is our introductory C++ programming class, and covers the basics of the language and the Standard Template Library.  We assume that you can already program in some object-oriented language, which will often be Java.  If you don't already know an object-oriented language, then you will have a hard time keeping up with the class.  If you have never programmed a computer at all, you will most likely be totally lost.  We also assume that you know some of the basic data structures, and are familiar with ""big-O"" notation.	Formerly CS 342S."
CSE,200,wustl,Engineering & Scientific Computing,"This class is intended to introduce students to the MATLAB programming environment, and to show them how to solve problems in science and engineering using it.  The class assumes no prior knowledge of computer programming.  One of the major goals of the class is to show students how they can solve some of the problems they will encounter as scientists and engineers using computational tools.	Formerly CS 265."
CSE,232,wustl,Software Engineering Workshop,"This is a short class designed to show students some tricks to make them more efficient C++ programmers.  It doesn't teach teach C++ programming and syntax, so if you can't write, compile, and run C++ programs already, you're not going to get much out of this class.  However, if you do know some C++ and would like to learn some practical ways to reduce the amount of time you spend programming (and debugging) your code, you might find this class interesting.	Formerly CS 242N."
EN,190,wustl,Special Topics in Space Engineering,"EN 190 was a project-based class focused on building things to launch into space.  In addition to building rover prototypes, the class supported Project Aria, which successfully launched and operated a number of nanosats.  The web page for Project Aria is long gone, but there's a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20010405084957/http://www.aria.cec.wustl.edu/"">partial archive</a> at the <a href=""https://archive.org"">Wayback Machine</a>."
