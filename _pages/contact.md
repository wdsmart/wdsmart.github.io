The best way to contact me is by [email](mailto:bill.smart@oregonstate.edu).  My office and lab space are both in [Graf Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Graf+Hall,+1680+SW+Monroe+Ave,+Corvallis,+OR+97331) on the main OSU campus.  If I'm on campus, that's where I'm likely to be.  However, I'm not on campus every day, so it's best to email me first if you want to meet.
