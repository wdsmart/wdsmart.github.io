At Oregon State, I primarily teach classes in Robotics and related areas.  You can find the classes that I'm currently teaching in the [OSU class catalog](https://classes.oregonstate.edu/?keyword=William%20Smart).  Before coming to OSU, I was on the faculty at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu), where I primarily taught classes in [Computer Science](https://cse.wustl.edu).
