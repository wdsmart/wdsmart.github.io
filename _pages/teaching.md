At Oregon State, I mostly teach classes in [Robotics](https://robotics.oregonstate.edu) and related areas, although I sometime teach classes in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mime.oregonstate.edu).  You can find the classes that I'm currently teaching in the [OSU class catalog](https://classes.oregonstate.edu/?keyword=William%20Smart).  Before coming to OSU in 2012, I was on the faculty at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu), where I mostly taught classes in [Computer Science](https://cse.wustl.edu).

    </p>
    
    <p>
        <i>The robots are coming!  Should we be excited or worried?  Should we fear our new metal overlords, or welcome them with open arms?  This class will introduce students with no technical background to the underlying technologies that robots rely on.  Students will learn about sensors (how robots see the world), actuators (how they affect the world), artificial intelligence (how they make decisions about what to do), and a range of other technologies used in robotics.  They will also learn to think critically about the practical limitations of these technologies, and how these limitations affect the kinds of tasks that robots can do now, and will do in the future.  At the end of the course, students will be able to evaluate the benefits and risks of this new emerging technology in a balanced way, based on a deep understanding of what's going on &quot;under the hood&quot;, rather than based on the hype that often surrounds robotics.</i>

    <summary><b>CSE 553: Advanced Mobile Robotics</b></summary>

    <p>
        This class follows on from CSE 550, and looks at some of the most recent work in the field of mobile robotics.  Lecture material is taken from current research papers, often less than a year old.  Students work on individual or small-group projects that implement the key elements of the papers that we cover in class.  Since we're covering advanced material in this class, we assume that you already know the basic algorithms and techniques of mobile robotics.  If you have not taken CSE 550, or an equivalent class, you're going to be hopelessly lost.  We also go into more mathematical detail in the class, so you should be comfortable with calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory.  Since much of the grade for this class is based on your project, you should be very comfortable writing and debugging code in C++ or Python (and preferably both).  Class projects for CSE 553 will use our research robot platforms.
